          <h1 class = C1H1>About Me (x302justice)</h1>
          <p class = "C1T1">I am a british computing student with an interest in software development and an on and off interest in web development. Currently, at the time of writing this, i am 19 and in my final year of attending college, and i am regarded as one of the students of all time. Some thing that won't be mentioned in other parts of this page are that i have an interest in modding games, and not just the hardware they're used for, as well as knowing how to solve a rubiks cube. This site exists as a way for me to display the work i've done as well as a way to store all the things that i have done into one place that can be easily accessible, like if linktree was made by a future alcoholic and only for one person.</p>

          <h1 class="C2H1">Homebrew/system modding</h1>
          <p class="C2T1">Ever since year 7 of school, a friend of mine modded my 3DS for me, which has turned into an interest that nears on obsession with modding my devices for my own personal use. Sometimes i try to make apps for my devices with this, to which most of them are generally unimpressive to most, however to me they are a big step in one directon or another. In the future, i also want to try making my own custom hardware based around a gaming system, like a custom dock for the nintendo switch.</p>
